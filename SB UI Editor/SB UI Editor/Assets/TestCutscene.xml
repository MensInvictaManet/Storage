	Events determine what happens and when in the cutscene. Each event has a trigger, a type, and some specific data
	that allows the system to enact the event.
	
	The first thing to note is the "type" label in the Event header. This determines how the system will interpret the 
	event and what data it will be looking for. All Events require a Trigger. PassMethod and EndingEvent tags are always 
	optional. Different types require different data in addition to these. Valid types and requirements are as follows:
		- SpriteChange (Requires Target, Asset)
		- WarpTo (Requires Target, X, Y)
		- MoveTo (Requires Target, X, Y, and Time)
		- SoundPlay (Requires Asset)
		- Wait (Requires Time)
		- Alpha (Requires Time and Asset)
		
	A Trigger can be of several types. Any event with a trigger type of "Start" occurs when the scene starts. You can also 
	put a time (in seconds) in as a trigger. It is suggested you use a floating point number. Putting 0.0 would be almost 
	the same as putting "Start" in, since they would both begin just after the timer started counting. Every event has the 
	ability to have an ending event as well, which can trigger other events. For example, if an event's EndingEvent is put 
	in as "Surprise" and another event has a trigger of "Surprise", the event with that trigger will go off as soon as the 
	other event ends. Take note that putting "Start" in as an ending trigger is not valid.
	
	A PassMethod is a way by which the player ends the event. Much like Triggers, this can be a method name, an amount of 
	time, or a trigger. In this way, you could have an event which passes another event when it ends. Advanced use of the 
	system will make this a bit clearer.
	
	The EndingEvent sends out an event call after the event ends. This can be used to trigger a new event by naming a string 
	and then using it as a Trigger in another event. Putting in "EndScene" for this will end the scene after the event.
	
	A Target is the actor that this event will occur with. Certain events will not require an actor. For example, if the 
	Asset is a sound file, it will not need an actor. The event will just play the sound. An example that requires an actor 
	is seen below. The Asset is a sprite, so it looks for the actor and assigns the sprite to it.
	
	X and Y are the x and y coordinates on screen. They are used when moving an Actor to a position on screen.
	(NOTE: Both numbers should be signed integers)
	
	Time is the amount of time that an event will take to occur. For example, in a MoveTo event, it is the time it takes the 
	Actor to reach it's specified destination.
	
	The Asset is the label of the resource that is used in the event. Given the asset type, the cutscene will determine if 
	it needs to assign the resource to an actor or utilize it in some other way. The asset can also be used to store a value.
